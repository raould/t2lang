# Phase1 → Phase0 Deduplication Plan 🔧

## Goal 🎯
Make `t2lang-phase1` a **thin wrapper** around `t2lang-phase0` so Phase1 contains only the minimal code needed to:
- act as a compatibility/adapter layer for features unique to phase1 (e.g., macro-related parsing hooks, dev utilities), and
- reuse core parsing, resolving, typechecking and codegen from `phase0` without duplication.

This reduces maintenance, avoids drift, and centralizes bug fixes and behavior in `phase0`.

---

## Non-goal ❌
- Merging the packages; this is a code dedup/refactor to call into Phase0 where appropriate, not a monorepo layout change.

---

## Scope & High-level Strategy 🧭
1. **Inventory**: Find duplicated files and APIs across `t2lang-phase1/src` and `t2lang-phase0/src`.
2. **Categorize** each duplication by feasibility: "extractable shared module", "phase1 specialization", or "incompatible".
3. **Introduce clear public APIs** in Phase0 (or a `common` package) for functionality Phase1 needs (parsing helpers, macro utilities, normalization helpers). Favor small, well-typed interfaces.
4. **Replace** Phase1 duplicates with adapters that import and call Phase0 APIs. Keep Phase1-specific logic localized to small shim modules.
5. **Tests & CI**: Add regression tests to lock in behavior. Run full test suites during each change.
6. **Iterate** in small, reviewable commits (one logical change per commit) until duplication is minimized.

---

## Progress Update (2026-01-17) ✅
- Extracted helpers into Phase0 and added focused tests:
  - **`GensymGenerator`** — `t2lang-phase0/src/lib/gensym.ts` + unit tests ✅
  - **`QuotedToAstConverter`** — `t2lang-phase0/src/lib/convertQuotedToAst.ts` + unit tests ✅
  - **`attachQuotedParsers`** — `t2lang-phase0/src/lib/quotedParser.ts` + unit test ✅
- Phase1 changes using Phase0 helpers:
  - `MacroExpander` delegates gensym and quoted→AST conversion to Phase0 helpers (reduced duplication).
  - Phase1 `Parser` now calls Phase0's `attachQuotedParsers` (quoted parsing centralized).
  - Added Phase1 integration tests covering nested splice/gensym edge cases (6 tests).
- Verification (local):
  - `t2lang-phase0` tests: **231/231** passing.
  - `t2lang-phase1` tests: **57/57** passing.
  - Lint: clean in both packages.

## Updated Inventory (what still lives in Phase1)
- Remaining Phase1-specific (heavier) files to consider next:
  - `src/parse/lexer.ts` — Phase1-specific lexer behavior for quasiquote/backtick handling (likely stays in Phase1 or becomes an opt-in extension).
  - `src/expand/macroExpander.ts` — core expander (now **thinner**; many helpers extracted to Phase0).
  - `src/api.ts` — compile driver / Phase1 entrypoint.
  - `src/cli.ts` — CLI glue that delegates to `t2lang-common`.
- Many other Phase1 files are thin wrappers/re-exports of Phase0 (parser adapter, resolver wrapper, typecheck wrapper, codegen re-exports, events, errors).

## Prioritized Next Steps (small, test-first, low risk) 🔜
1. **Extract low-risk helpers** from `macroExpander` into Phase0 (one helper per change):
   - `flattenQuotedArgs` / splice flattening (isolated and high value)
   - `substituteAndExpand` / `evalQuote` helpers (next largest; add unit tests)
2. **Add focused tests** (≤10 per change) for nested splices, quoted let-binding forms, and other edge cases observed during debugging.
3. **Tighten parser hooks**: add types for parser extension points and make `attachQuotedParsers` strongly typed.
4. **Consider `expandMacros` API**: once helpers are extracted and well-tested, expose a Phase0 `expandMacros` or `MacroExpansion` facade so Phase1 can become a small adapter that only orchestrates config and top-level callbacks.

## Testing & Rollout (unchanged)
- Keep each extraction to a small, reviewable commit/PR with unit tests in Phase0 and integration tests in Phase1.
- Verify by running `cd <pkg> ; npm run lint ; npm test` in both packages before merging.

## Inventory (initial findings) 🔎
Files and areas to inspect (candidate duplicates):
- `parse/lexer.ts` (both packages — lexing differences around backtick/quasiquote)
- `parse/parser.ts` (Phase1 has wrappers/quoted parsing helpers)
- `expand/macroExpander.ts` (Phase1-specific, but many utilities for evaluating quoted forms may be shareable)
- `codegen/tsCodegen.ts` (Phase0 contains final codegen, Phase1 reuses this but ensure shared types)
- `tests/` (many macro tests live in Phase1: consider moving common parser/macro tests to Phase0 or to a shared test harness)

Note: Phase1 intentionally diverges where macro handling is needed; aim to keep only the adapter surface in Phase1 and extract the heavy logic into Phase0 (or `common`).

---

## Proposed Phased Workplan (small steps) ✅

### Phase A — Preparation (small, low-risk)
- Add `DEDUPE_PLAN.md` and a short ADR if desired. (done)
- Add regression tests that capture failing cases we fixed earlier (`mkchain`, `mkblock`, `where`, `gensym` hygiene) to ensure no regressions when moving code.
- Add `TODO`-style comments in Phase1 indicating candidate extraction points.

Acceptance: tests and lint remain green after adding tests.

### Phase B — API Extraction (medium risk)
For each duplicate area:
- Extract a well-defined helper into `t2lang-phase0/src/lib` or a new `common` package (e.g., `parseQuotedSexpr`, `normalizeQuotedAst`, `expandGensym`, `spliceMarker` handling).
- Add unit tests for the extracted helper in Phase0.
- Replace Phase1 duplicate implementation with a small shim that imports the helper.

Make changes package-by-package, commit per helper.

Acceptance: Unit tests in both packages and integration macro tests pass after each helper extraction.

### Phase C — Parser/Tokenizer Centralization (higher risk)
- If Phase1's `Lexer` changes are small and compatible, standardize on Phase0's `Lexer` as the canonical implementation and add flags or extension points for Phase1-specific behavior.
- Introduce a `ParseOptions` interface and pass a `mode: 'phase0'|'phase1'` flag where necessary.
- Ensure `Parser` has extension hooks for Phase1 (e.g., quoted-list parsing) implemented in Phase0 behind optional callbacks.

Acceptance: No behavioral change in macro expansion tests and Phase1 can be initialized as a client of Phase0's Parser.

### Phase D — Macro Expander Harmonization (highest risk)
- Move macro-expansion core logic into Phase0 as a public `expandMacros` API or into `common` if semantic boundaries demand it.
- Keep Phase1-specific converters/normalizers as small translators.
- Add comprehensive tests around quoted forms, splice flattening, gensym, and nested macro expansion.

Acceptance: All macro tests pass and Phase1's surface-level adapter is < 100 LOC per module for macros.

### Phase E — Cleanup & Documentation
- Remove duplicated files, update README/MACROS.md to point to canonical logic locations.
- Add comments documenting why Phase1 remains thin and what extension points exist.
- Add a short migration note for contributors.

---

## Testing Strategy 🧪
- Add regression tests to `t2lang-phase1/tests/integration/examples` for all previously problematic macros (done already for many cases).
- Add unit tests for each extracted helper inside Phase0's `tests/unit`.
- Run full `npm run lint` and `npm test` in both packages on CI for each PR.

---

## Risk & Mitigation ⚠️
- Risk: Behavioral drift when extracting logic. Mitigate by adding focused tests around semantics before refactor and running full test suites after each change.
- Risk: Cyclic dependencies between packages. Mitigate by using a `common` package or keeping helpers in Phase0 with deliberate public API surface.

---

## Rollout & PR Guidelines ✳️
- Make one helper extraction per PR (small, reviewable changes).
- Each PR must: run `cd <pkg> ; npm run lint ; npm test` and attach test logs to the PR description.
- Keep changes backwards compatible; if API breakage is inevitable, add a deprecation layer and document it.

If you'd like, I can start with the **first extraction** (pick a small helper to extract, add tests, and replace a Phase1 duplicate) and submit the changes in small commits. Which helper would you like me to extract first: `parseQuotedSexpr`, `convertQuotedToAst`, or `expandGensym`?
